# Generative AI Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture for our Generative AI application framework.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

Our Generative AI architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

## 1. Application Layer

The application layer serves as the entry point for user interactions and orchestrates the flow between components.

### Key Components:
- **API Gateway**: Handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
- **Application Services**: Implements business logic and coordinates between components
- **User Interface**: Web, mobile, or CLI interfaces for user interaction

## 2. LLM Integration Layer

This layer abstracts interactions with various LLM providers, offering a unified interface regardless of the underlying model.

### Key Components:
- **Model Clients**: Provider-specific API clients (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)
- **Request Managers**: Handle batching, retries, and error handling
- **Response Processors**: Process and standardize model outputs

### Flow Diagram:

```
User Request → Application Service → Model Manager → Provider Client → LLM API
                                                                        ↓
User Response ← Response Processor ← Error Handler ← Response Handler ← API Response
```

## 3. Prompt Engineering Layer

This layer manages the creation, versioning, and optimization of prompts.

### Key Components:
- **Prompt Templates**: Parameterized prompt structures
- **Prompt Chains**: Sequences of prompts with conditional logic
- **Context Managers**: Handle conversation history and context windows

### Prompt Template Example:
```python
class ProductDescriptionTemplate(BasePromptTemplate):
    """Generate product descriptions based on attributes."""
    
    def format_prompt(self, product_name, features, target_audience, tone="professional"):
        """Format the prompt with product details."""
        return f"""
        Generate a compelling product description for {product_name}.
        
        Product features:
        {self._format_features(features)}
        
        Target audience: {target_audience}
        Tone: {tone}
        
        The description should highlight the key benefits and include a call to action.
        """
    
    def _format_features(self, features):
        return "\n".join([f"- {feature}" for feature in features])
```

## 4. Data Layer

This layer manages the storage, retrieval, and processing of data used by the application.

### Key Components:
- **Vector Database**: Stores and retrieves embeddings for semantic search
- **Prompt Repository**: Manages prompt templates and versions
- **Dataset Manager**: Handles training and evaluation datasets

### Data Flow:

```
Raw Data → Preprocessing → Embedding Generation → Vector Storage
                                                      ↓
User Query → Query Embedding → Vector Search → Relevant Context → Enhanced Prompt
```

## 5. Evaluation & Monitoring Layer

This layer tracks performance, usage, and quality metrics.

### Key Components:
- **Metric Collectors**: Gather performance and quality metrics
- **Usage Monitors**: Track token consumption and API usage
- **Quality Evaluators**: Assess response quality and model performance

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

```
User Query → Query Understanding → Vector Search → Context Retrieval → Enhanced Prompt → LLM → Response
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Processing

```
Initial Prompt → Reasoning Steps Generation → Intermediate Result → Final Reasoning → Conclusion → Response
```

### 3. Tool Augmentation

```
User Query → Intent Recognition → Tool Selection → Tool Execution → Result Integration → LLM → Response
```

## Deployment Architecture

Our system supports multiple deployment models:

### 1. Serverless Deployment

- **API Gateway**: Amazon API Gateway / Google Cloud Endpoints
- **Application Logic**: AWS Lambda / Google Cloud Functions
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone / Weaviate
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch / Cloud Monitoring

### 2. Container-based Deployment

- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **API Gateway**: Kong / Traefik
- **Observability**: Prometheus / Grafana

### 3. Hybrid Deployment

For scenarios requiring both cloud scalability and on-premises data security:

- **Sensitive Components**: On-premises deployment
- **Scalable Components**: Cloud deployment
- **Secure Communication**: VPN / Direct Connect

## Security Architecture

Our security architecture implements defense in depth:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - API Keys with granular permissions

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - PII detection and redaction
   - Secure credential management

3. **Input/Output Safety**
   - Prompt injection prevention
   - Output content filtering
   - Rate limiting and quota enforcement

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally:

1. **Stateless Components**
   - Application services designed for horizontal scaling
   - Load balancing across multiple instances

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Response caching for frequent queries
   - Embedding caching for common lookups
   - Distributed cache for session state

3. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Message queues for workload distribution
   - Background processing for non-interactive tasks
   - Webhook callbacks for long-running operations

## Extensibility

The architecture supports extension through:

1. **Plugin System**
   - Custom tool integrations
   - Domain-specific prompt templates
   - Custom evaluation metrics

2. **API-First Design**
   - Well-documented internal APIs
   - Webhook integration points
   - Event-driven architecture

## Technology Stack

Our reference implementation uses:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **LLM Integration**: LangChain / LlamaIndex
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone / Weaviate / Qdrant
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus / Grafana
- **Deployment**: Docker / Kubernetes

This architecture provides a solid foundation that can be adapted to specific use cases while maintaining the core principles of modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
